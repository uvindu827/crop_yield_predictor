##Business problem and Goal
**Business problem:** For a farmer who is considering planting a specific crop (like 'Wheat' or 'Soybean'), there is significant uncertainty about the potential outcome. Key decisions about resource allocation—how much to invest in fertilizer, pesticides, and labor—are made with incomplete information about the expected final yield.

The core business problem is that this uncertainty in yield for a chosen crop leads to high financial risk and inefficient planning. A farmer might over-invest in a field that is destined for a low yield or under-invest in a field with high potential, hurting the farm's overall profitability and stability.

**Project goal:** The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that provides a reliable yield prediction for a specific crop, given a set of environmental and agricultural inputs.

The primary function of this model is to answer the question: "If I plant [Crop X] under these specific conditions (soil pH, temperature, rainfall, etc.), what is the most likely yield I can expect?"

By providing an accurate forecast, this tool will empower farmers to:

  -Create more accurate financial budgets and secure loans.

  -Optimize resource management (fertilizer, water, etc.) for the chosen crop.

  -Better anticipate revenue and manage their operations with data-driven confidence.
