📈 Business Problem & Project Goal
💡 Business Problem

For farmers deciding to plant a specific crop (e.g., Paddy or Soybean), there’s significant uncertainty about the expected yield.
Decisions about resource allocation — such as fertilizer, pesticide, and labor investments — are often made without accurate information about the potential outcome.

This uncertainty can lead to:

💸 Financial risk due to over- or under-investment.

⚙️ Inefficient farm management and reduced profitability.

🎯 Project Goal

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the yield of a chosen crop based on a set of environmental and agricultural factors such as:

🌦️ Temperature

💧 Rainfall

🌱 Soil type

🌾 Whether conditions

This model aims to answer the question:

“If I plant [Crop X] under these specific conditions, what is the most likely yield I can expect?”
